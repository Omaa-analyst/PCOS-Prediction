HERE IS A SUMMARY OF THE PCOS PREDICTION PROJECT I WORKED ON WHICH HAS TO DO WITH DATA PROCESSING AND MODEL TRAINING:


1. Data Import and Inspection: 
   - Imported the dataset and checked basic information such as column names, data types, and missing values.
   
2. Handling Missing Data: 
   - Identified and handled missing values for key columns by filling NaNs with appropriate methods.
   
3. Encoding Categorical Variables: 
   - Applied One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical variables into binary columns.
   - Used custom mappings to convert string values in BMI and Stress Levels columns into numeric values.
   - Applied the mappings to the respective columns (BMI & Stress Levels).

4. Data Type Verification: 
   - Verified and corrected data types for consistency and ensured that all columns had the correct type.

5. Label Encoding: 
   - Initialized and applied LabelEncoder to convert binary/categorical columns to numeric values.
   
6. Feature Standardization: 
   - Standardized numerical features to ensure they are on a comparable scale.

7. Feature and Target Variable Definition: 
   - Defined features (independent variables) and target variable (dependent variable).

8. Data Splitting: 
   - Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

9. Model Training and Evaluation: 
   - Trained a prediction model on the training set.
   - Evaluated model performance with classification reports and confusion matrix.

10. Model Visualization: 
    - Visualized results by plotting feature importance and showing the confusion matrix.

11. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Visualized the distribution of Age and BMI.
    - Used Pairplot to explore relationships between numerical features (Age, BMI, Lifestyle Score, and Stress Levels).
    - Generated a correlation heatmap to analyze feature correlations.
